### :coffee: A little history behind this project...
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) allows you to manage a lot of aspects of Github in an automatic and secure way (create branches, secure branches, create users to the organization,...)<br>With [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), you can get through the whole project management and human resources part autonomously and quickly.<br>I wanted to implement [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) in a personal setting as well as in [WebReady Projects](https://github.com/WebReadyProjects/) to provide a fast system to make project and human resource management really fast.
