### :coffee: A little history behind this project...

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) allows you to manage a lot of aspects of Github in an automatic and secure way (create branches, secure branches, create users to the organization,...)<br>With [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), you can get through the whole project management and human resources part autonomously and quickly.<br>I wanted to implement [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) in a personal setting as well as in [WebReady Projects](https://github.com/WebReadyProjects/) to provide a fast system to make project and human resource management really fast.<br>This project is a draft of [Terraform's](https://www.terraform.io/) capability for multiple Github project management, which you can now use as needed.

### :rocket: Get Started
- Check out [the Hashi Corp tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- Go to your Github settings, then to the "Developer Settings" tab, then create a new key with the appropriate settings checked.
- Once the [repo download](https://github.com/GregoireF/Terraform/releases) is on your computer, launch your code editor and go to init.tf to modify the `token` `owner` fields
- Run the command `terraform init` then `terraform plan` then `terraform apply` and you will see the magic happen :mage:
