### :coffee: A little history behind this project...

actions-template is a project to include github-actions for each start of a new project via Github.com. This project is intended to help create consistency in open source collaborative development.<br>To follow the Github guidelines as much as you can, it is recommended to have a "development" branch so as not to impact the main branch during development.<br>To make nice commits, you can look at [the guideline around Github commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [a list of icons](https://github.com/GregoireF/actions-template/blob/main/.github/GUIDELINE_COMMITEMOJI.md) to use for your titles too.

##

### :rocket: Get Started

- Make a fork to the desired location (organisation or your profile)
- Go to the settings of your newly created project and check in your options that the "Template repository" box is checked
- You can now create new projects using the "Repository template" option and choose your project that contains the Github-Actions workflow
- [Install Renovate Bot](https://github.com/marketplace/renovate)
- :tada: You can now use Github Actions!
